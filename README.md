# Predicting the Approval of Credit Card Application

## Introduction
In this project, I use data processing and machine learning techniques to predict the approval of credit card application.  
The logistic regression model predicts the outcome of the credict card applications with extremely high accuracy.

## Data Source
The credit card approval dataset is from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval).   
It is a collection of the applicants of credit card and the corresponding approval decisions.
